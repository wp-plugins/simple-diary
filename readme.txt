A very simple diary listing user created reminders. Ready to use in WordPress default themes.

== Description ==

Simple Diary is meant to be simple enough to be used out of the box. Simple, but also powerfull and customizable. All skill user should find something to do with it.

Here's the list of the settings (see screenshots for further infos):

* Custom post type "reminder" available. The reminder infos : Title, start date (required), end date (optional), start time(optional), end time (optional), location (required), url (optionnal), article (optional). The date and time infos are set using [pickadate.js](http://wordpress.org/ "Go to the pickadate.js homepage") jQuery plugin. All the system (compose reminder page and datepicker) is responsive.
* The admin reminders edit page is sorted by start date and contain title, start date, end date, location and creation/modification date. All columns are sortable except location column.
* Option page will let you modify some settings : Title of the diary page, slug modification, reminder count listed in upcoming reminders.
* All default WordPress themes (twentyten, twentyeleven, twentytwelve, twentythirteen, twentyfourteen) can easily be updated to take in account the reminders. You just have to get archive-reminder.php, content-reminder.php or loop-reminder.php, single-reminder.php from `/simple-diary/themes-support/your_theme/` and put it into your hteme folder (`/wp-content/themes/your-theme/`).
